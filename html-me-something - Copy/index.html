 <p >Located an hour &amp; a half outside of the bustling city of Puerto Vallarta in the State of Jalisco, 
   sits , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/Panader%C3%ADa-Carmens-Bakery-830152453842606/posts/?ref=page_internal">Carmen&apos;s Panaderia</a>. 
   Stepping out of the bus, the smell of fresh bread baking in the outdoor ovens and beans cooking over on open firepit filled the air. 
   A look around the Hacienda was a delight for the eyes!<br>
   We found hidden gems in the gardens overlooking the gorge, became nostalgic upon entering the children&apos;s garden area complete with swing and a dollhouse,
   started sweating at the sight of so many chilies spread on the ground to dry, and were tickled by the moral laden, humorous tale of a mug with a broken ear shared 
   by Carmen&apos;s jaunty family member. Carmen&apos;s has been in this location for many years. Carmen&apos;s has been the last stop (or first if traveling out of the mountains) before
   venturing down the very narrow, less than one lane dirt road and back up to the other side. The old road down in and out of the ravine was treacherous and travel was condition 
   dependant. Since the road, in most places, allowed for only 1 vehicle at a time with minimal areas to wait for oncoming traffic to pass, the journey could take hours, luckily
   Carmen&apos;s Panaderia was there to provide a cool place to rest, grab a drink and a snack and soothe weary travelers and tourists before proceeding onward.</p>

      <h3>Progress with the Puente Progreso!</h3>
         <p>In 2006, 80 years after the then President of the Republic met with the inhabitants of San Sebastian del Oeste to discuss building a bridge 
        to San Sebastia&#769;n, <br>construction finally began. Puente Progreso is an engineering marvel! In roughly 12 months, 200 men working 24
        hours a day, <br>completed the structure, providing safe and efficeint travel for the inhabitants of the mountains and opening the way for more tourism dollars.</p>

<p>This bridge, built in the early 1600&apos;s, is the entrance to the mining town of San Sebastia&#769;n, Jalisco, Mexico. San Sebastia&#769;n, a mining town nestled in the <br>
   Sierra de la Madre, was founded by silver miners in 1605. With 25 mines in the area (gold, silver, zinc and lead), San Sebastia&#769;n eventually became one of 
   the principal mining areas of New Spain.</p>

   <p>San Sebastia&#769;n is a town rich with history and culture. The majority of the villas, haciendas and other structures in San Sebastia&#769;n have stood along <br>
      side these cobblestone walkways for hundreds of years. A lovely town rich in history and tradition. <br>Mid-day parents walk to the edge of town to meet their children who have been released from school for siesta.</p>
